# org-jira Spacemacs layer

This Spacemacs layer allows using Jira from within org-mode.

* Installation

- Clone the git repository somewhere and add it as a private layer in spacemacs

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone git@github.com:jfim/org-jira.git
    ln -s "`pwd`/org-jira" ~/.emacs.d/private/org-jira
#+END_SRC

- Add the =org-jira= layer to your =.spacemacs= file
- Add the Jira url to your =.spacemacs= file. For example, if your Jira is
  installed at https://example:443/secure/Dashboard.jspa
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq jiralib-url "https://example:443")
  #+END_SRC

- Configure the directory in which =org-jira= will create org files. You
  probably want to add it to your agenda files as well, so that org-agenda can
  show your jira tickets as part of your todo list. =org-jira= will create one
  file per Jira project in this directory. For example, if you're assigned
  projects FOO and BAR, it'll create =FOO.org= and =BAR.org= in this directory,
  each containing the tickets assigned to you.
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq org-jira-working-dir "~/org-jira")
  #+END_SRC

- Optionally you may want to configure your agenda to include the jira tickets.
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (setq org-agenda-files '("~/org" "~/org-jira"))
  #+END_SRC


- Optionally configure your jira credentials in =~/.authinfo= with machine being
  the (computed) jiralib-host, and the port being 80 (even if you are using
  https for Jira):

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    machine JIRALIB-HOST login USERNAME password XXXXX port 80
  #+END_EXAMPLE
    
  If you do not set USERNAME here, then it will be prompted using the
  minibuffer; if you set the wrong username/password, then it wonâ€™t work.

This example shows inclusion of the layer and defineing the necessary variables.

** Get started

- Open a random org file, it doesn't matter which one.

- Explore the keybindings under =, j=

- Press =, j i g= (='org-jira-get-issues=) to retrieve all Jira tickets assigned
  to you. It'll ask for a login and password. This will create org files in the
  =org-jira-working-dir= previously configured.

- Start working on a Jira ticket by opening the relevant org file, moving your
  cursor onto a Jira ticket and then pressing =, j i w=
  (='org-jira-progress-issue=)

- Comment on a ticket by adding a =Comment:= subheading :
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ** Comment:
    This is a commont on the ticket
  #+END_EXAMPLE

- You'll then need to synchronize the comment with =, j c u=
  (='org-jira-update-comment=)

- You can change the ticket priority by editing the =:priority:= value in the
  =:PROPERTIES:= drawer and syncing it with =, j i u= (='org-jira-update-issue=)

- To get the latest updates on a ticket, you can refresh it by pressing =, j i
  r= (='org-jira-refresh-issue=)

- You can also view the current ticket in your browser by pressing =, j i b=
  (='org-jira-browse-issue=)

- Finally, when you're done with the ticket, you can close it by doing =, j i w=
  (='org-jira-progress-issue=) and selecting =Close issue=. You may need to hit
  backspace if the autocompletion suggestion is hiding the close option.

** Usage

When in org-mode:

- =, j p g= ='org-jira-get-projects=
- =, j i b= ='org-jira-browse-issue=
- =, j i g= ='org-jira-get-issues=
- =, j i h= ='org-jira-get-issues-headonly=
- =, j i f= ='org-jira-get-issues-from-filter-headonly=
- =, j i F= ='org-jira-get-issues-from-filter=
- =, j i u= ='org-jira-update-issue=
- =, j i w= ='org-jira-progress-issue=
- =, j i r= ='org-jira-refresh-issue=
- =, j i c= ='org-jira-create-issue=
- =, j i k= ='org-jira-copy-current-issue-key=
- =, j s c= ='org-jira-create-subtask=
- =, j s g= ='org-jira-get-subtasks=
- =, j c u= ='org-jira-update-comment=
- =, j t j= ='org-jira-todo-to-jira=
